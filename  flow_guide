Topic 1: Advanced Code Generation & Formatting

File: demo_artifacts/topic1_generation.py
Pre-Demo Setup: The presenter for this topic must follow the custom_template_guide.md to create the newcust template before the demo.

Motivation:
A developer's time is valuable. We should focus on solving complex problems, not on typing repetitive "boilerplate" code, remembering parameter names, or manually fixing code style. These tools act as an intelligent assistant to write better, more consistent code, faster.

Flow:

Code Completion (Objects): In topic1_generation.py, go to the main_app function (line 21). On the line after c1 = Customer(...), type c1. to show the .name and .level attribute suggestions.

Docstring Generation: Go to the get_customer_from_db function (line 11). Delete the empty """""" (line 12), then type """ again on the empty line and press Enter to show the template generation.

Custom Live Template (newcust): Go to the bottom of the main_app function (line 22). Type newcust and press Tab to generate your custom c$VAR$ = Customer(...) template.

Live Template (main): Go to the bottom of the file (line 26). Delete the if __name__ == "__main__": block, then type main and press Tab to regenerate it.

Code Reformatting: Go to the Customer class (line 6). Show the messy self.name = name; self.level = level line, then press Ctrl+Alt+L (or Cmd+Option+L) to auto-format it.

Topic 2: Code Refactoring & Analysis

File: demo_artifacts/topic2_refactoring.py

Motivation:
The first draft of code is never the final draft. "Refactoring" is the process of cleaning up code structure without changing what it does. These tools let us perform complex changes (like renaming a variable in 10 places) safely and instantly, and they also find hidden bugs ("code smells") for us.

Flow:

Code Inspection: In calculate_total_bill (line 23), hover over the yellow underline on shipping = 5.00. Explain the "Local variable 'shipping' value is not used" warning. (Optional: Delete the line to fix it).

Rename Refactor (Var 1): Right-click the q parameter (line 4), use Refactor > Rename (or Shift+F6), and change it to quantity. Show that it updates on line 7.

Rename Refactor (Var 2): Rename the p parameter (line 4) to price. Show it updates on line 7.

Extract Method: Select the entire "Part 3: Add shipping" block (lines 22-31).

Right-click and use Refactor > Extract > Method... (or Ctrl+Alt+M).

Name the new method _calculate_shipping. (Optional: If PyCharm adds a Literal type hint that causes an error, simply delete the type hint from the new function's parameters).

Topic 3: Integrated Testing (Pytest)

Files: demo_artifacts/topic3_logic.py, demo_artifacts/test_topic3.py
Pre-Demo Setup: Ensure pytest is installed (Python Packages > Search 'pytest' > Install) and set as the default test runner (Settings > Tools > Python Integrated Tools > Default test runner > pytest).

Motivation:
How do we prove our code works? How do we make sure a change didn't break something else? We write automated tests. These tests are a "safety net" that catches bugs automatically. PyCharm's integrated tools let us run and analyze these tests visually, which is much faster than using a command line.

Flow:

Show the Code & Test Files: Briefly show topic3_logic.py (the Calculator class with a bug) and test_topic3.py (the test_ functions).

Run All Tests: Right-click the test_topic3.py file tab and select Run 'pytest...'.

Show Test Runner: Show the visual test runner window with its green checks and red X.

Analyze Failure: Click the failed test_divide_by_zero_fails_demo. Show the AssertionError and the "Expected: 'Error', Actual: None" diff.

Fix the Code: Go to topic3_logic.py (line 13). Change return None to return "Error".

Re-run Single Test: Go back to test_topic3.py and click the green "play" icon next to only the test_divide_by_zero_fails_demo function. Show it pass.

Topic 4: The Integrated Debugger

File: demo_artifacts/topic4_debugger.py

Motivation:
What happens when your code runs but gives the wrong answer? Using print() statements is slow and messy. The Debugger is the professional tool for this. It lets us "pause time"—freezing our program on a specific line to inspect all the variables, step through the logic, and find the exact source of the bug.

Flow:

Run Normally (Show Bug): Run the file. Show the console output is an incorrect 4x4 square of asterisks, not a triangle.

Set Breakpoint: In topic4_debugger.py, click in the gutter next to line 14 (the for j in... loop) to add a red dot.

Start Debugger: Right-click the file and choose Debug....

Inspect (Loop 1): The code pauses. Point to the "Variables" pane: n is 4, i is 1.

Find Bug (Step Over): Press "Step Over" (F8). The code adds a *. j is 1. Press "Step Over" again.

The "Aha!" Moment: j is now 2... but i is still 1. The inner loop is running too many times! It's going all the way to n instead of i.

Stop & Fix: Click the "Stop" button. Go to line 14 and change range(1, n + 1) to range(1, i + 1).

Re-run & Verify: Run the file normally (Run, not Debug). Show the correct triangle output.

Topic 5: The Integrated TODO Tool

Files: demo_artifacts/topic5_main.py, demo_artifacts/topic5_utils.py
Pre-Demo Setup: Make sure the TODO tool window is open (View > Tool Windows > TODO).

Motivation:
This topic uses a detailed script to show how PyCharm turns simple code comments (# TODO) into a powerful, interactive project management dashboard that is 100% offline.

The 5-Minute Demo Script:

(0:00 - 0:45) — The Hook: "Stop Losing Your Code Notes"
"Hi everyone. We all write comments in our code like 'TODO: fix this' or 'FIXME: this is a bug.' The problem is we forget where they are. PyCharm solves this with the TODO Tool Window. It's a live, interactive dashboard for all the 'technical debt' and notes you've left for yourself and your team."
(Point to the TODO tool window, which should already show the comments from topic5_main.py and topic5_utils.py)

(0:45 - 2:00) — Feature 1: Your Interactive Code GPS
"This window automatically scans your entire project in real-time, grouped by file. You can see I have one TODO and one FIXME.
The best part is instant navigation. If I want to tackle this 'broken input' bug..."
(Double-click the FIXME item in the TODO list).
"Boom. PyCharm instantly opens topic5_main.py and puts my cursor on that exact line. Now I'll jump to the caching issue..."
(Double-click the TODO item for topic5_utils.py).
"And I'm instantly in topic5_utils.py. No searching, no file-switching. It's a GPS for your code tasks."

(2:00 - 3:30) — Feature 2: Making It Your Own (Custom Tags)
"But it's not just for 'TODO' and 'FIXME'. You can create any pattern you want. Let's say our team wants to mark code for 'REVIEW'.
I'll go to Settings > Editor > TODO."
(Navigate to the settings menu).
"I'll click the + icon to add a new pattern. I'll type in \bREVIEW\b.*
And to make it stand out, I'll give it a custom color—let's make it bright blue and bold."
(Quickly add the pattern, set a color, and hit 'OK').
"Now, I'll go back to my topic5_main.py file and add a new comment:"
(Type this in topic5_main.py): # REVIEW: Is this the most efficient way to do this?
"Now look... as soon as I type it, it instantly appears in my TODO window, highlighted in the new blue color."

(3:30 - 4:30) — Feature 3: Scopes & Filtering (Staying Focused)
"In a huge project, this list could have hundreds of items. This is where scopes and filters come in.
First, I can filter by my custom tags. I'll click the 'Filter' icon and uncheck TODO and FIXME."
(Click the filter icon in the TODO window, uncheck the defaults).
"And now, I only see my 'REVIEW' items.
But my favorite feature is changing the scope. Right now, it's set to 'Project'.
Let me open topic5_main.py. Now, I'll change the scope to 'Current File'."
(Click the scope button (looks like a folder/funnel) and select 'Current File').
"The list instantly filters to show only the tasks in the file I'm working on. If I switch my editor to topic5_utils.py, the TODO list automatically updates. This keeps the list focused on what you are doing right now."

(4:30 - 5:00) — The Wrap-Up
"So, the TODO tool automatically finds all your code notes, acts as an interactive GPS, lets you create custom tags, and filters by scope to keep you focused. It's a simple, powerful tool that turns messy comments into an organized, actionable checklist."

Topic 6: Tasks & Contexts

Files: demo_artifacts/topic6_task_A.py, demo_artifacts/topic6_task_B.py

Motivation:
A developer is constantly interrupted. You'll be deep in a complex feature (Task A) when a manager asks you to fix an urgent bug (Task B). This "context switch" is expensive—you have to close all your files and later try to remember where you were. This tool saves your entire workspace (your "context") so you can switch between tasks in seconds.

Flow:

(0:00 - 0:45) — The Hook & Motivation

Script: "Good morning. I'll be demonstrating Topic 6: Tasks and Contexts. The motivation is this: a developer's biggest enemy is interruptions. This tool is our "interrupt-shield." It saves our entire workspace—not just files, but breakpoints, bookmarks, and even Git branches—so we can juggle multiple tasks without losing our minds. I'll demo this by juggling three tasks."

(0:45 - 1:30) — Step 1: Start "Task A" (The Main Feature)

Action: Go to Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Open Task...

Action: Create a Local Task named "Task A: Analytics Feature".

Action: When prompted, create a new Git branch named feature/analytics.

Script: "I'm starting my main feature. I'll open my task and create a new Git branch for it."

Action: Now, create your rich context:

Open topic6_task_A_main.py.

Set a Breakpoint on line 30 (self.processed_data = ...).

Open topic6_task_A_utils.py.

Set a Bookmark (e.g., Ctrl+F11) on line 16 (return [...]).

Script: "My 'context' is complex. I have two files open, a breakpoint in one, and a bookmark in the other. This is my 'flow'."

(1:30 - 2:30) — Step 2: Interruption 1 ("Task B" - Urgent Bug)

Action: Go to Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Open Task...

Script: "Oh no—an urgent bug. I'll switch tasks."

Action: Create a Local Task named "Task B: Fix Payment Bug".

Action: In the dialog, create another new Git branch named hotfix/payment-bug.

Script: "PyCharm asks to Save Context for Task A. I'll say yes. It also automatically switches my Git branch to hotfix/payment-bug."

Action: The workspace is now clean. Open topic6_task_B_bugfix.py and set a Breakpoint on line 27 (print(f"Connecting...")).

Script: "My workspace is clean. I've opened the bug file and set a new breakpoint for this task."

(2:30 - 3:15) — Step 3: Interruption 2 ("Task C" - Quick Review)

Script: "I'm in the middle of the bug fix, and a teammate asks for a quick code review. Another interruption!"

Action: Go to Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Open Task...

Action: Create a Local Task named "Task C: Review Refactor".

Action: This time, select "Don't change branch" (since you're just reviewing).

Script: "I'll create a third task. PyCharm will save my 'Task B' context."

Action: The workspace is clean again. Open topic6_task_C_refactor.py.

Script: "I'll open the refactor file, look at it, and I'm done. Now, let's go back up the stack."

(3:15 - 4:15) — Step 4: Restoring the Stack (The "Magic")

Script: "First, let's get back to that bug."

Action: Go to Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Switch Task... and select "Task B: Fix Payment Bug".

Script: "PyCharm asks to restore my 'Task B' context."

Action: Click "Restore Context".

Script (The first "Aha!"): "Instantly, the Task C file closes, topic6_task_B_bugfix.py re-opens, and my breakpoint on line 27 is back. My Git branch is also back to hotfix/payment-bug."

Script: "Okay, bug is fixed. Now... where was I on my main feature?"

Action: Go to Tools > Tasks & Contexts > Switch Task... and select "Task A: Analytics Feature".

Action: Click "Restore Context".

(4:15 - 4:45) — Step 5: The Full Restore (The "Wow" Moment)

Script: "And this is the real magic. My workspace is exactly as I left it two interruptions ago."

Action: Show the screen.

topic6_task_A_main.py is open.

topic6_task_A_utils.py is also open.

The Breakpoint on line 30 of main is back.

The Git branch is back to feature/analytics.

"And even my Bookmark in the utils file is still here." (Action: Open the Bookmarks window (Shift+F11) to prove it).

(4:45 - 5:00) — The Conclusion

Script: "This tool isn't just a file-switcher. It's a complete workspace manager that saves your files, breakpoints, bookmarks, and automates your Git branches, letting you manage multiple interruptions without losing your focus. Thank you."
